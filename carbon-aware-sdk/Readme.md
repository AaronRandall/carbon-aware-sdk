The Carbon Aware SDK project is an initiative to bring home the concept of building sustainable applications to the development community. There are multiple flavors of the SDK being
planned.

For native integration with programming languages a library will be developed. For integration with REST portals, a Web API will be exposed and a command line interface will also be present
